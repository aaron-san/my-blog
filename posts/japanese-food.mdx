## Rice

Rice is the staple food in Japanese dishes. We eat rice with about 98% of our at-home meals. We do have pasta on occasion, but this is rare.

### Rice, Eggs, and Soup

    Cold ramen, aka "hyashichu", is a summer dish that we love. It involves
    boiling the ramen noodles and cooling them. Then we cut slices of ham, fried
    egg and cucumbers. The noodles are covered in a vinagerette sauce. Superb!

    One of our favorite dinners is tomato hot dish. It typically includes
    chopped chicken pieces mixed with chopped carrots, egg plant, onions and
    other vegetables. The tomato sauce is usually sweetened with chicken stock
    boullion. The scrambled eggs are sweetened with "tsuyu" noodle sauce and soy
    sauce.
