## Rice

Rice is the staple food in Japanese dishes. We eat rice with about 98% of our at-home meals. We do have pasta on occasion, but this is rare.

### Rice, Eggs, and Soup

  <div>Cold ramen, aka "hyashichu", is a summer dish that we love.</div>
</div>

Making cold ramen involves boiling the ramen noodles and cooling them. Then we cut slices of ham, fried
egg and cucumbers. The noodles are covered in a vinagerette sauce. Superb!

  <div>One of our favorite dinners is tomato hot dish.</div>

Tomato hot dish typically includes chopped chicken pieces mixed with chopped carrots, egg plant, onions and other vegetables. The tomato sauce is usually sweetened with chicken stock boullion. The scrambled eggs are sweetened with "tsuyu" noodle sauce and soy sauce.

Recently, we have been enjoying some delicious egg plant that my wife cooks. It is
cooked with sesame oil and ginger. It is the best egg plant we have ever tasted!
Needless to say, we enjoy some healthy food!

### School Lunch

On school days, Japanese children all get a balanced meal for lunch. Every student and teacher eats the same meal. Most meals are served with a side of white rice. However, noodles are common too. Ramen noodles and udon noodles are the most common noodles served. Each come with a bowl of soup.

  <div>Curry and rice is among the favorites of Japanese children.</div>
</div>

The main dish is usually fish or chicken with fish being the most prominent. The side dish is usually a pickled vegetable salad. Students are served milk 97% of the time. On special days they are given a coffee milk, which is a sugary milk with coffee flavor. It's pretty good, actually. ðŸ˜‹
