It is well known among our friends that we are regulars at [Niko-Niko Terrace](https://www.city.sayama.saitama.jp/shisei/shisaku/irumagawa/tokoton/terrace-open.html) park in Iruma City, Japan. It is a perfect place for viewing cherry blossoms, for kids to play, and for a nice relaxing break at the nearby Starbucks. We usually leave in the morning and let the kids play on the playground when we arrive. Sometimes, our kids like to ride their bicycles on the large paved square as well.

    My son is eating a fruit pack sent from his grandma in the U.S. He sucks it
    dry as fast as he can. It's that good!

  While we usually eat lunch at the park, we sometimes take breaks for a light
  snack. We usually order a Starbucks oatmilk or almond milk latte and the kids
  drink a juice or hot cocoa.
