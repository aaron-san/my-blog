### The Park

It is well known among our friends that we are regulars at [Niko-Niko Terrace](https://www.city.sayama.saitama.jp/shisei/shisaku/irumagawa/tokoton/terrace-open.html) park in Iruma City, Japan. It is a perfect place for viewing cherry blossoms, for kids to play, and for a nice relaxing break at the nearby Starbucks. We usually leave in the morning and let the kids play on the playground when we arrive. Sometimes, our kids like to ride their bicycles on the large paved square as well.

### Snack Time

While we usually eat lunch at the park, we sometimes take breaks for a light snack. Here, Noah is eating a fruit pack sent from his grandma in the U.S. He sucks it dry as fast as he can. It's that good!
