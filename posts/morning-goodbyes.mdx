    My daughter makes the funniest faces when it's time for me to leave for
    work.

  Mornings are usually fast-paced for me. I wake up about 40 minutes before I
  must leave for work. Usually, I get dressed, make breakast and leave while the
  family is sleeping. However, some days, my daughter wakes up before I leave
  and comes down stairs. It is daddy-daughter morning time. Of course, I can't
  make breakfast for her as good as her mommy, so I just give her toast or
  cereal. The real fun starts when It's time to say goodbye.

    Sometimes it gets stranger and stranger. I can't help but worry about her.
    Hahaha. I think she takes after mommy. ðŸ˜‰
