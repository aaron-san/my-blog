## Enjoying the Sofa

    Our kids really love our sofa. It's considerably smaller than a typical
    American sofa, but it is comfortable. Our kids took over the sofa and began
    jumping and playing too much with it. After our son got hurt somewhere else,
    we decided to remove the sofa temporarily. The kids miss it. Haha.
