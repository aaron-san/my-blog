Our daughter's kindergarten has a parent-child arts and crafts day once a year.
One parent goes to school with their child and there is a prepared activity.

  After our arts and crafts time, she likes to play on the playground. She was
  so proud to show me her ability to hang upside down. She called herself
  "laundry."
